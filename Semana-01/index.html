        <h2>Reports</h2>
        <p>
          Our solution has several reports that can be generated,
          including a report on the work hours of each employee in each project and
          work team. This report can be used to track employee productivity
          and to identify any areas where employees may be slacking off.
        </p>
        <h2>Time tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Trackgenix has a time-tracking feature that allows employees to log their work hours for each project and work team.
          This feature is useful for businesses to track the work hours of their employees and to ensure that they are being used efficiently.
        </p>
        <h2>Resource management</h2>
        <p>
          Our software has helped us to improve our resource management by allowing employees
          to log their work hours in a central location.
          This has made it easier for managers to track employee productivity
          and identify areas where improvements can be made.
        </p>
        <h2>Multiple roles</h2>
        <p>
          The app will allow each employee to log in and select the project
          they are working on and the work team they are part of.
          They will then be able to select the hours they worked and submit them.
          The app will then calculate the total hours worked for each employee and project.
