# Trackgenix

- Description

GigaTech Software Solutions SA provides software development services to other companies. Because it has many employees and projects, they have asked us to develop a web system, which we will call "Trackgenix", to facilitate the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.

- How to open:

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DamianPalavecino/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1.git
```

2. Access to the main folder and then open the folder of the week that you want to see.

3. Open the file '**index.html**' on your browser.

## Week 01

Me and my groupmates created the screenflow for the Trackgenix App in Figma.

## Week 02

During this week, I created a GitHub repository for the project. After that, I started working on the HTML file for the landing page of Trackgenix. I added the basic HTML tags for the layout.

## Week 03

In this week, I am going to add styles in the HTML file using CSS to imitate the landing made in the screenflow.

## Week 04

During this week, I will modify the CSS files to make the design responsive by using Flexbox.
