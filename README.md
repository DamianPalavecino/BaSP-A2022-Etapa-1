- Description

GigaTech Software Solutions SA provides software development services to other companies. Because it has many employees and projects, they have asked us to develop a web system, which we will call "Trackgenix", to facilitate the recording of hours worked by each employee in each project and work team.

- How to open:

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DamianPalavecino/BaSP-A2022-Etapa-1.git
```

2. Access to the main folder and then open the folder of the week that you want to see.

## Week 01

Me and my groupmates created the screenflow for the Trackgenix App in Figma.

## Week 02

During this week, I created a GitHub repository for the project. After that, I started working on the HTML file for the landing page of Trackgenix. I added the basic HTML tags for the layout.

## Week 03

In this week, I am going to add styles in the HTML file using CSS to imitate the landing made in the screenflow.

## Week 04

During this week, I will modify the CSS files to make the design responsive by using Flexbox.

## Week 05

In this week, I will work on some JavaScript exercises. Also, I will fix any mistakes in the HTML & CSS files of the past week.

## Week 06

During this week, I am going to add the login and sign up pages and style them. Also, I am going to add JavaScript to give functionality to the login, sign up and contact pages.

## Week 07

In this week, I am going to continue working on the login and sign up pages with the addition that now they are going to be connected to data stored in a web server.
